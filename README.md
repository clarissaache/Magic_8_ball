# Hi! Welcome to my first Demo

### I am Clarissa

In this demo I am going to show you what I built for the first project of this class

* This is very tiny service. It's just one Python function that I created in an AWS Virtual Machine (Cloud 9)
* It is exposed throguh an API, im using FastAPI
* It is deployed using AWS AppRunner, which is hooked to my github repo where this project lives and will deploy directly from it

## What does the function do?
Just like we saw in class, this function just adds two numbers that you type directly into the URL

# Do you want to see it?
(watch it here: ___)
