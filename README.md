# Hi! Welcome to my first Demo

### I am Clarissa

In this demo I am going to show you what I built for the first project of this class

* This is very tiny service. It's just one Python function that I created in an AWS Virtual Machine (Cloud 9)
* It is exposed throguh an API, im using FastAPI
* It is deployed using AWS AppRunner, which is hooked to my github repo where this project lives and will deploy directly from it

## What does the function do?
This is a digital magic 8 ball that can give you 100% accurate predictions of whatever question you ask it.
